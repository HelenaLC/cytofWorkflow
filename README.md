# CyTOF workflow: differential discovery in high-throughput high-dimensional cytometry datasets

## Installation 

All the packages necessary to run the workflow become available by installing the `cytofWorkflow` package, which can be installed via Github. First, you need to install `devtools` if you haven't already:

```
install.packages("devtools")
```

Now you can install `cytofWorkflow`:

```
devtools::install_github("gosianow/cytofWorkflow")
```

The workflow can be executed by following the instructions in the cytofWorkflow.Rmd file available in the  [vignettes directory](https://github.com/gosianow/cytofWorkflow/blob/master/vignettes/cytofWorkflow.Rmd).
